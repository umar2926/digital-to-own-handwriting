# digital-to-own-handwriting
This repository contains a Flask web app for recognizing handwritten characters. Users can upload images with handwritten text, which are processed with OpenCV to extract and save individual characters without backgrounds. The app allows manual annotation of characters and uses this data to recognize handwritten text from user input.
